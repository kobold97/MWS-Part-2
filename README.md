# MWS-Part-2
Second part of my awesome project with Udacity!
1) Clone the repository 
2) Run: 'npm i' in your cli.
3) Run: 'npm run prod' to get the production version running.
4) The new folder named 'dist' will appear.
5) That's where you should start running your http server.

6)I also had the development version but it crashed and doesn't work anymore xD.

PS
Don't forget to run Udacity server. You can download it here:
